# Intro To Full Stack

üëã Welcome!

## What are we building?

We are going to build a product similar to [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) (an online platform to practice data structures and algorithms to prep for software engineering interviews ), although similar we are going to take a more gamified perspective on the platform taking inspiration from the UI League of Legends and combing computer science majors two favorite things. 

So what does ‚ÄúLeet of Legends‚Äù entail, Chat GPT describes it as 

**Leet of Legends (LoL)** is a dynamic coding competition platform where participants either go head-to-head or team up in squads of up to four to race against the clock‚Äîand each other‚Äîin solving coding challenges. Drawing inspiration from competitive gaming, this platform takes the practice of algorithms and data structures and turns it into a thrilling showdown. Whether it's a one-on-one duel or a team clash, the objective remains: to be the first to crack the code. Gamified leaderboards, achievements, and real-time spectating make every race an adrenaline-pumped coding experience.

If you do not want to read that it's a platform where people will be able to race against other players to see who can solve the Leetcode problem first.
